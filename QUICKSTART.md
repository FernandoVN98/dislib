## Quickstart guide

There are two ways in which you can get started with dislib. You can perform 
a [manual installation](#manual-installation), or you can download our 
ready-to-use [docker image](#using-docker). 

### Manual installation

#### Dependencies

dislib currently requires:

* PyCOMPSs == 2.5
* Scikit-learn >= 0.19.1
* Scipy >= 1.0.0
* NumPy >= 1.15.4

Some of the examples also require matplotlib >= 2.0.0 and pandas >= 0.20.1. 
numpydoc >= 0.8.0 is requried to build the documentation.

#### Installation steps 

1. Check which PyCOMPSs version to install. 
    * Latest dislib release requires **PyCOMPSs 2.5** (check [here](https://github.com/bsc-wdc/dislib/releases) for information about other releases).
    
2. Install PyCOMPSs following these [instructions](http://compss.bsc.es/releases/compss/latest/docs/COMPSs_Installation_Manual.pdf).

3. Install the latest dislib version with ``pip3 install dislib``.
   * **IMPORTANT:** dislib requires the ``pycompss`` Python module. However, this command will **NOT** install the module automatically. The module should be available after manually installing PyCOMPSs following the instructions in step 2. For more information on this, see [here](https://github.com/bsc-wdc/dislib/issues/190).

4. You can check that everything works fine by running one of our examples:

    * Download the latest source code [here](https://github.com/bsc-wdc/dislib/releases/latest).
    
    * Extract the contents of the tar package.
    
    ```bash
    tar xzvf dislib-0.1.1.tar.gz
    ```
    
    * Run an example application.
    
    ```bash
    runcompss --python_interpreter=python3 dislib-0.1.1/examples/kmeans.py    
    ```

### Using docker

#### 1. Install Docker and docker-py

**Warning:** requires docker version >= 17.12.0-ce


1. Follow these instructions

   - [Docker for Mac](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac). Or, if you prefer to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

   - [Docker for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce-1).

   - [Docker for Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Docker#Installation).

Be aware that for some distros the docker package has been renamed from `docker` to `docker-ce`. Make sure you install the new package.

2. Add user to docker group to run dislib as a non-root user.

    - [Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)


3. Check that docker is correctly installed

```
docker --version
docker ps # this should be empty as no docker processes are yet running.
```

4. Install [docker-py](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

```
sudo pip3 install docker
```

#### 2. Install dislib

```
sudo pip3 install dislib
```

This should add the dislib executable to your path.

#### 3. Start dislib in your development directory

Initialize dislib where your source code will be (you can re-init anytime). This will allow docker to access your local code and run it inside the container.

**Note** that the first time dislib needs to download the docker image from the registry, and it may take a while.
```
# Without a path it operates on the current working directory.
dislib init

# You can also provide a path
dislib init /home/user/replace/path/
```

#### 4. Run a sample application

**Note**: running the docker dislib does not work with applications with GUI or with visual plots such as `examples/clustering_comparison.py`).

First clone dislib repo and checkout release 0.1.0 (docker version and dislib code should preferably be the same to avoid inconsistencies):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bsc-wdc/dislib.git
git co v0.1.0
```

Init the dislib environment in the root of the repo.
The source files path are resolved from the init directory which sometimes can be confusing. As a rule of thumb, initialize the library in a current directory and check the paths are correct running the file with `python3 path_to/file.py` (in this case `python3 examples/rf_iris.py`).

```bash
cd dislib
dislib init
dislib exec examples/rf_iris.py
```

The log files of the execution can be found at $HOME/.COMPSs.

You can also init the library inside the examples folder. This will mount the examples directory inside the container so you can execute it without adding the path:
```bash
cd dislib/examples
dislib init
dislib exec rf_iris.py
```

#### 5. Adding more nodes


**Note**: adding more nodes is still in beta phase. Any suggestion, issue, or feedback is highly welcome and appreciated.


To add more computing nodes, you can either let docker create more workers for you or manually create and config a custom node.

For docker just issue the desired number of workers to be added. For example, to add 2 docker workers:
```
dislib components add worker 2
```

You can check that both new computing nodes are up with:

```
dislib components list
```

If you want to add a custom node it needs to be reachable through ssh without user. Moreover, dislib will try to copy the `working_dir` there, so it needs write permissions for the scp.

For example, to add the local machine as a worker node:

```
dislib components add worker '127.0.0.1:6'
```

* '127.0.0.1': is the IP used for ssh (can also be a hostname like 'localhost' as long as it can be resolved).
* '6': desired number of available computing units for the new node.

**Please be aware** that `dislib components` will not list your custom nodes because they are not docker processes and thus it can't be verified if they are up and running.
